### Feel free to dig around in the code if you want an example!

The intent of this repro is to show off my projects and other work, while providing a way to contact me in case you're interested in anything. It uses some basic javascript for moving and scaling elements on the webpage, and has a relatively clear structured html and alphabetically (and catagorically) sorted css.
