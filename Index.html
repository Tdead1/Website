		<h1> Projects </h1>
			<p> Below are a few of the projects that I have worked on over the last few years, click on any of them to see my role and more details. 
			I'm best at working in Unreal Engine 4 or Godot for developing games. Then again, I'm a quick study and have worked in large codebases and custom engines, 
			so picking up a new/different engine won't take me long.

					<h1> Bioside: 0G VR Shooter</h1>
					<p>I was a rapid prototyper and lead programmer on this project.</p>
					<p> We worked in a team of 19 people to create a VR shooter with innovative movement mechanics. I created all but one of the guns and grenades, while also working as communication point 
					for the 7 programmers in the team.</p>

					<p> This game doesn't have gravity. That means you're pulling yourself around the level while shooting rocket launchers, machine guns, revolvers and more at hostile drones. Creating these
					weapons was amazing, working with gameplay designers to get everything to feel just right. The story of the game is that you're boarding a ship where the AI has gone rogue, and you're there
					to shut it down forcefully. Getting the movement under control is tricky at first, but when you get used to it you are flying around the ship shooting things left and right.</p>

				<h1> BaBooms: Unreal Engine 4 Multiplayer Game. </h1>
				<p> I created the base for the project and did all the networking logic.</p>
				<p> For this project, I started out as the only programmer. I was in charge of making the gameplay, and to get it to work on a local network. Later on, more programmers joined the team, 
				although my role stayed the same.</p> 
				</br>
				<p style="white-space: pre;">Duration:  7 weeks.</br>Team:         13 people.</br>Role:           Network programmer.</br>When:        May and June 2017</p>
				
				<img src="Resources/Images/Babooms1.png" style="width: 50%"/><img src="Resources/Images/Babooms2.png" style="width: 50%"/>
				
				<p> This is a 4 player team based game that's all about sabotaging your opponents while trying to find specific monster parts. The players control hopping baboons who
				are trying to build a monster out of limbs. The parts are scattered around the map and the goal is to collect all parts and bring them back to your own lab, to bring the monster to life. 
				The first team to get all the parts wins the game. You're able to place traps and utilities around the level to delay or your opponents or gather information.</p>
				<p> Although this was just a school project, I learned the basics of networking from these 7 weeks of development. </p>

				<h1> Shattered Lights: Year-long UE4 VR Horror Game. </h1>
				<p> Still under development. I am creating the player interaction systems, inverse kinematics and other hand logic.</p>
				<p> For this project, we were taught how to properly research and explore a genre, which was VR horror for us. We researched the target audiences, horror classics and much more for the first
				8 weeks of development. We then created a proper vertical and horizontal slice in the 8 weeks after that, to deliver a short but terrifying experience. That is the state of our project now. 
				Our team is confident that we can make a succesful game out of this project.</p> 
				</br>
				<p style="white-space: pre;">Duration:  32 weeks.</br>Team:         18 people.</br>Role:           Lead Programmer/Game Programmer.</br>When:        September 2018 - (expected) June 2019</p>

				<p> What makes this horror game special is that it is in full room scale, which means no player locomotion whatsoever, no teleporting or weird swinging around with your arms. We make the level
					traversable by using Non-Euclidean spaces, like in the game Antichamber, allowing the player to move an indefinite distance in the same 3x3 meters space.</p>

				<h1> Here are a bunch of my Game Jams. </h1>
				<p>I really like doing Game Jams with a group of people, so I try to do one at least every year. Here are the results of the last three:</p>
				<h1><a href="https://globalgamejam.org/2019/games/snowscape">Snowscape</a></h1>
				<p> Our GGJ 2019 game, we created a multi-year, multi-disciplinary team and created a really <b>cool</b> game with our team of 8. <br/><br/> A charming adventure puzzler about a little robot who lost its way. You awaken
				in a frozen landscape, with your last bit of battery power you roll towards a power station and restore part of your strength. Reinvigorated, you set out on your journey back home. Explore 
				the frozen landscape to discover parts to upgrade yourself and use your newfound abilities (like a magnet and a laser) to traverse the landscape and restore power to a terraforming pylon in 
				order to melt the wall of ice that blocks your  path home.</p>

				</br>
				<h1><a href="https://tdead1.itch.io/white-pickets">White Pickets</a></h1>
				<p> A less amazing result, but a far smaller and more inexperienced team. For the Epic MegaJam, we created this game in one week with only three developers. One of us had no experience in creating games but could draw quite well. Another did
				the 3D art and character designs, while I did the programming, audio, and all implementations for art and animation.</p>

				</br>
				<h1><a href="https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/crystal-dash">Crystal Dash</a></h1>
				<p> The first ever Game Jam for all of us, we created a small game about a spirit protecting its forest home. In our team of 7 first year game developers, we managed to put down a relatively good result. I was the only programmer on the team,
				so I did all of the game logic, like player movement, attacks and camera work. The only thing I didn't end up doing was the AI, as a designer wanted to learn a bit more about how AI works in Unreal Engine 4. </p>
