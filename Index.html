			I'm a game developer working on large scale projects. I fit well in teams, I've been a programmer in several different roles over the last few years, getting more experienced with a lot of subjects. 
			I love prototyping, which has allowed me to get more experience with a variety of different subjects, such as developing for VR, networking, inverse kinematics, writing math libraries. </p>
			
			
			<p style="text-align: left;">
			In short, I excel at creating features realiably and quickly, preferably in collaboration with a large team of designers and artists. Here are some of my preferred tools:

			<p> Below are a few of the projects that I have worked on over the last few years, click on any of them to see my role and more details. 
			I'm best at working in Unreal Engine 4 or Godot for developing games. Then again, I'm a quick study and have worked in large codebases and custom engines, 
			so picking up a new/different engine shouldn't take me too long.</p>

					<h1> Bioside: 0G VR Shooter</h1>
					<p>I was a rapid prototyper and lead programmer on this project.</p>
					<p> We worked in a team of 19 people to create a VR shooter with innovative movement mechanics. I created all but one of the guns and grenades, while also working as communication point 
					for the 7 programmers in the team.</p>					
					<p style="white-space: pre;">Duration:  8 weeks.</br>Team:         19 people.</br>Role:           Rapid prototyper/lead programmer.</br>When:        Summer vacation 2017</p>

					<p> This game doesn't have gravity. That means you're pulling yourself around the level while shooting rocket launchers, machine guns, revolvers and more at hostile drones. Creating these
					weapons was amazing, working with gameplay designers to get everything to feel just right. The story of the game is that you're boarding a ship where the AI has gone rogue, and you're there
					to shut it down forcefully. Getting the movement under control is tricky at first, but when you get used to it you are flying around the ship shooting things left and right.</p>

				<h1> TiFrame: Personal C++ framework. </h1>
				<p>I was the sole developer of this framework.</p>
				<p> What initially started as a pesonal project to learn more about rendering later developed into a basic C++ framework that supports rendering, resource loading and management, 
				uses a entity component system to manage objects. I'm using ImGUI to help me create the UI. This is a personal project, and I have written all the code for it by myself.</p>
				<p style="white-space: pre;">Duration:  6 weeks.</br>Team:         1 person.</br>Role:           Engine programmer.</br>When:        Summer vacation 2017</p>

				<h1> BaBooms: Unreal Engine 4 Multiplayer Game. </h1>
				<p> I created the base for the project, and did all the networking logic.</p>
				<p> For this project, I started out as the only programmer. I was in charge of making the gameplay, and to get it to work on a local network. Later on, more programmers joined the team, 
				although my role stayed the same.</p> 
				</br>
				<p style="white-space: pre;">Duration:  7 weeks.</br>Team:         13 people.</br>Role:           Network programmer.</br>When:        May and June 2017</p>
				
				<img src="Resources/Images/Babooms1.png" style="width: 50%"/><img src="Resources/Images/Babooms2.png" style="width: 50%"/>
				
				<p> This is a 4 player team based game that's all about sabotaging your opponents while trying to find specific monster parts. The players control hopping baboons who
				are trying to build a monster out of limbs. The parts are scattered around the map and the goal is to collect all parts and bring them back to your own lab, to bring the monster to life. 
				The first team to get all the parts wins the game. You're able to place traps and utilities around the level to delay or your opponents or gather information.</p>
				<p> Although this was just a school project, I learned the basics of networking from these 7 weeks of development. </p>
