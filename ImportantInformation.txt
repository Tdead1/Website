   I'm a game developer who is interested in working on large scale projects. I fit well in teams,
   I'm social and get along well with just about everyone. I've been a programmer in several different
   roles over the last few years, getting more experienced with a lot of subjects, including prototyping,
   networking, leading, and even more specific things such as developing for the Raspberry Pi, inverse 
   kinematics and writing math libraries.
